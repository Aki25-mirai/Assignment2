	A small bar  tucked away in a century-old renovated shop house is introducing a brave concept to pay what you want.
	You talk to the  Cocktail bartender about what you would like—cold brews in the daytime, cocktails at night—and 
	slide the cash you think it’s worth into a wooden box on the bar.
<strong>Mr.Cocktail</strong> also stands out for its diminutiveness; with just enough space for 14 people, it claims to be the smallest café in Yangon.
But its size does not restrict an intriguing décor inspired by 19th Century Burmese tattoo manuscripts.
Painted by artist,the auspicious creatures, words, numbers and angels are said to protect from evil forces and endow magical powers.
